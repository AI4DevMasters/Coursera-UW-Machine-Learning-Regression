Week 1:
- 1.0 Introduction
- 1.1 Simple Regression: Linear regression with one input
  - Describe the input (features) and output (real-valued predictions) of a regression model
  - Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
  - Estimate model parameters to minimize RSS using gradient descent
  - Interpret estimated model parameters
  - Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
  - Discuss the possible influence of high leverage points
  - Describe intuitively how fitted line might change when assuming different goodness-of-fit metrics
