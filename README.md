- Week 1:
  - Simple Linear Regression:
    - Describe the input (features) and output (real-valued predictions) of a regression model
    - Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
    - Estimate model parameters to minimize RSS using gradient descent
    - Interpret estimated model parameters
    - Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
    - Discuss the possible influence of high leverage points
    - Describe intuitively how fitted line might change when assuming different goodness-of-fit metrics
