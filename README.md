- Week 1:
  - Simple Linear Regression:
    - Describe the input (features) and output (real-valued predictions) of a regression model
    - Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
    - Estimate model parameters to minimize RSS using gradient descent
    - Interpret estimated model parameters
    - Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
    - Discuss the possible influence of high leverage points
    - Describe intuitively how fitted line might change when assuming different goodness-of-fit metrics

- Week 2:
  - Multiple Regression: Linear regression with multiple features
    - Describe polynomial regression
    - Detrend a time series using trend and seasonal components
    - Write a regression model using multiple inputs or features thereof
    - Cast both polynomial regression and regression with multiple inputs as regression with multiple features
    - Calculate a goodness-of-fit metric (e.g., RSS)
    - Estimate model parameters of a general multiple regression model to minimize RSS:
      - In closed form
      - Using an iterative gradient descent algorithm
    - Interpret the coefficients of a non-featurized multiple regression fit
    - Exploit the estimated model to form predictions
    - Explain applications of multiple regression beyond house price modeling
